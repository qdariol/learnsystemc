# 08 - Event

An event is an object of class sc_event used for process synchronization.
A process instance may be triggered or resumed on the occurrence of an event, i.e., when the event is notified.
Any given event may be notified on many separate occasions.

sc_event has the following methods:
  1. void notify(): create an immediate notification
  2. void notify(const sc_time&), void notify(double, sc_time_unit):
    a) zero time: create a delta notification.
    b) non-zero time: create a timed notification at the given time, expressed relative to the simulation time when function notify is called
  3. cancel(): delete any pending notification for this event
    a) At most one pending notification can exist for any given event.
    b) Immediate notification cannot be cancelled.

Constraints:
  1. Objects of class sc_event may be constructed during elaboration or simulation.
  2. Events may be notified during elaboration or simulation, except that it shall be an error to create an immediate notification during elaboration or from one of the callbacks:
    a) before_end_of_elaboration,
    b) end_of_elaboration, or
    c) start_of_simulation.

A given event shall have no more than one pending notification:
  1. If function notify is called for an event that already has a notification pending, only the notification scheduled to occur at the earliest time shall survive.
  2. The notification scheduled to occur at the later time shall be cancelled (or never be scheduled in the first place).
  3. An immediate notification is taken to occur earlier than a delta notification, and a delta notification earlier than a timed notification. This is irrespective of the order in which function notify is called.

Events can be combined with each other, and with a timer. This example shows a process waiting for only one event.
